## Introduction

The VR Four Stroke Engine Simulation and Learning App aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding of a four-stroke engine's functioning. By immersing users in a VR environment, the app provides an intuitive way to visualize and interact with the engine's components, as well as gain insights into its operational phases.

## Features

- **Immersive VR Environment:** Step into a realistic VR environment where you can explore and manipulate the components of a four-stroke engine.

- **Interactive Learning:** Engage in a hands-on learning experience by interacting with individual parts of the engine, observing their movement, and understanding their role in the four-stroke cycle.

- **Quiz Round:** Test your knowledge with an interactive quiz round that challenges you to identify engine parts, explain their functions, and comprehend the entire four-stroke process.

- **Unity and Blender Integration:** The simulation is built using Unity for seamless interaction and Blender for creating detailed 3D models of the engine components.
